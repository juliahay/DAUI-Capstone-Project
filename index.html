        <h1>ACCESSIBILITY GAME</h1>
        <p>The point of the game is simple: find the answer to the given prompt. </p>
        <p>But here's the rub: you won't be able to see any of the page's content.</p>
        <p>Users with visual impairments have a bit harder time navigating websites because of their disability, so this game hopes to similuate what accessing a website as a visually impaired person might be like. The goal of the game is to give you a better understanding of why we need accesible websites. Without being able to see, you have to rely on the keyboard and how the website is coded to get any of the information on the page.</p>
        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <p>1. When you press "Start Game," you will be given a prompt asking you to find a specific piece of information which can be found on that page.</p>
        <p>2. To find the information you're looking for, you will use the Tab key to move around the page.</p>
        <p>3. Press the Spacebar to have whatever you've highlighted read aloud.</p>
        <h4>Make sense? Well, it's time to play!</h4>
