        <h1>ACCESSIBILITY GAME</h1>
        <p>The point of the game is simple: find the answer to the given prompt. But here's the rub: you won't be able to see any of the page's content.</p>
        <p>Users with visual impairments have a bit harder time navigating websites because of their disability so this game hopes to similuate what accessing a website as a visually impaired person might be like. The goal of the game is to give you a better understanding of why having accessible websites is so necessary. Without being able to see, you have to rely on the keyboard and what is coded onto the page in order to get the information presented.</p>
        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <p>1. When you press "Start Game," you will be given a prompt asking you for a specific piece of information which can be found on the following page.</p>
        <p>2. To find the information you're looking for, you will use the Tab key to move around the page.</p>
        <p>3. Press the Spacebar to have whatever you've highlighted read aloud.</p>
        <p>4. To interact with the page to play videos or press buttons, press the Enter key.</p>
        <h4>Make sense? Well, it's time to play!</h4>
